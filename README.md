## Introduction

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the application’s data amongst other things.
The course is totally free of charge. You can get a certificate and even the University of Helsinki ECTS credits for free.
The course is worth 5-14 credits, and the content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023. There is also an associated project that is worth 1-10 credits.
Partners and affiliates of the course include Houston Inc, Terveystalo, Elisa, Unity Technologies and Konecranes. See here for guest lectures on course-related topics given by various experts from our partners and affiliates.
Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and to know the basics of working with the Git version-control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and the ability for independent problem solving and information seeking.
